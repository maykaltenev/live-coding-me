  <h4>Why DCI?</h4>
  <img src="./DCI.png" width="300px" />
  <p>
    Ever since I was a child I was fascinated by computers and how they
    worked.<br />
    Growing up in the World Wide Web era, made me realise the importance of
    the<br />
    technologies and the impact they have on our society. I believe coding is<br />
    magic and being a Web Developer, will give me a magic wand with which I
    can<br />
    inspire people, be part of the digitalization movement and help our
    society.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The DCI has the perfect programme</em> for me, I will gain not only
    all<br />
    the necessary programming tools, but also to polish my German language
    and<br />
    soft skills, which I consider the right set of talents I need.<br />
