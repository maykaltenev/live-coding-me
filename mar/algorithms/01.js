// Algorithm
// * Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output;
// * The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order;
// * The steps also need to be distinct;
//  * The algorithm should produce a result;
//  * The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time;
// Algorithmic Thinking:
// clearly define what the problem set is and clarify what values count as inputs
// the output should match the value we are looking for;
// Type of algorithms
// 1. linear search 
//  - start at beginning
//  - move sequently 
//  - compare current value to target
//  - reach end of list
//NB! Algorithms should produce a result;
